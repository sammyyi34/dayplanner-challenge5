Description:
This is a work schedule organizer website/app in which the user can input their daily work plans according to the time. The times are your average work days 9AM - 5PM.
The timeslots dynimcally change in real time. When a certain time has passed the time slot will turn gray, the current time slot will be red, and all future time slots are green. The user input texts are then stored in their local storage and stays printed on the time slot even though the user reshreshs/closes their browser.
